      ProxyManager Installation
    -----------------------------
    
This document is for ProxyManager v0.9.

Before installing, if you have not done so yet, you may want to view the 
included README file.

Quick installation instructions are available online at
  https://github.com/Tahaan/proxymanager/wiki/Installation

Prerequisites
-------------
This program does not have many prerequisites.  A working Linux system will 
likely have everything that is needed, but Core Utils are required, as well as 
a Bourne Again (bash) compatible shell.

While the software will work without a proxy server somewhere, or even a 
working network, it would be rather pointless.  A locally installed proxy 
server such as CNTLM is suggested as that was what this program was originally
developed for.  ProxyManager does not care what the proxy server is, or
whether it is local or elsewhere on the network:  It simply turns the setting 
to use the Proxy server on or off for each program.

Installation
------------
1. Become ROOT (you may try: sudo -s)
2. If you are upgrading:
  2.1 Backup your enabled modules links - you may try
       cd /Old/ProxyManager/dir
       tar cvf /tmp/proxy-modules.tar enable/ disable/
  2.2 Delete any old version of ProxyManager / pOn / proxy_on 
3. Change to where you want to install ProxyManager, try
    cd /usr/local
4. Extract the archive.  It will create a proxymanager/ directory
   and some sub-directories.
       tar xvf ~/Downloads/ProxyManager-v0.1.tar
5. Create a configuration file.  You can do it manually or you can use the  
   provided script, try
       cd /usr/local/proxymanager/
       ./proxymanager-setup
   To manually set up the ProxyManager configuration file refer to the sample 
   file sample-proxymanager.conf
6) Enable/disable desired modules. Refer to the next section for information
   on Enabling/Disabling modules.  In addition if this is an upgrade you may
   want to restore your links, eg try
       cd /usr/local/proxymanager
       tar xvf /tmp/proxy-modules.tar
7. Stop being root (Ctrl-D)
8. Add some aliases to turn proxy on/off to your ~/.bashrc file, e.g
    alias p-on="/usr/local/proxymanager/proxymanager on"
    alias p-off="/usr/local/proxymanager/proxymanager off"
    alias p-ck="/usr/local/proxymanager/proxymanager off"

Configuration
-------------
   Default Configuration file: /etc/proxymanager.conf

   Default Install directory:
 PM_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/proxymanager

   Modules Directory              : $PM_INSTALL_DIR/modules
   Templates Directory            : $PM_INSTALL_DIR/templates
   Active Modules Enable and Check: $PM_INSTALL_DIR/enable
   Active Modules Disable         : $PM_INSTALL_DIR/disable

Enabling/disabling modules
--------------------------
Modules shipped with ProxyManager are installed in $PM_INSTALL_DIR/modules. When
running "proxymanager on" or "proxymanager check", ProxyManager runs all modules
linked from $PM_INSTALL_DIR/enable/.  When running "proxymanager off"
ProxyManager runs the modules linked in $PM_INSTALL_DIR/disable/

Modules are enabled by creating a soft-link from the enable and disable
directory to the module script in $PM_INSTALL_DIR/modules, eg:

/usr/local/proxymanager/enable$ ls -l
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 johan johan 14 Sep 26 12:45 E01kde -> ../modules/kde
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root  root  17 Sep 26 13:05 E02wgetrc -> ../modules/wgetrc
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root  root  17 Oct 14 13:48 E03curlrc -> ../modules/curlrc

Note: a Module is ENABLED by creating two links, one for turning the proxy
setting on, and one for turning it off, for the specific application.  A module
is disabled by removing both links.

The number in the link file name determines the run-order.  While applications 
do not often depend on one another for Internet connections, but it is possible.  
Some (eg a package manager) may depend on global or system settings though, so 
the facility exists to control the order in which the modules are invoked to 
affect a setting update.

Additionally if the PM_USERMODULES variable specifies a valid directory, modules
which does not require root will be executed from this directory.  In this case
only the root-priv modules from $PM_INSTALL_DIR/enable or
$PM_INSTALL_DIR/disable will be used.

The PM_USERMODULES variable can be specified in .proxymanrc in the user's home
directory.

Note: A script is included to automate the process of setting up the links to
enable or disable modules.  The script is still very much untested.  You can
try:

proxymanager-module enable modulename
    Enabled the specified module called "modulename" (Create links for it)

proxymanager-module disable modulename
    Disabled the specified module named "modulename" (Remove the links)

proxymanager-module list
    Displays a list of currently enabled modules (Checks the links)

proxymanager-module avail
    Display a list of available modules which exist in
    the PM_INSTALL_DIR/modules directory

Manual module link management
 o Enabling a module
    cd /usr/local/proxymanager/
    ln -s ../modules/apt enable/suE02apt
    ln -s ../modules/apt disable/suD03apt

 o Disabling a module
    rm /usr/local/proxymanager/disable/suD*apt
    rm /usr/local/proxymanager/enable/suE*apt

Any modules with root (sudo) requirements will run before all modules that are 
not using sudo for start-up.  For stop/disable proxy use, the non-sudo modules
runs before the sudo modules. (Regardless of numbering)

 o Links are to be named starting with a capital E to enabled them for the user
 o Links are to be named starting with capital D for Disable for the user
 o Links are to be named starting with "suE" to enabled them for root / system
   wide
 o Links are to be named starting with suD for Disable for system wide / root


Configuration file
------------------

The configuration file is located at /etc/proxymanager.conf.  The file is parsed
inline and sets up needed configuration variables for ProxyManager.

The file can be created manually - a sample configuration file is included in the installation directory.  The file can also be created or updated using the supplied proxymanager-setup script.

PM_INSTALL_DIR indicates where the main program, which is used as the base dir 
to locate the respective subdirectories for modules, templates and the  
links for enabled modules.
    Default : PM_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/proxymanager

ProxyManager uses PM_USERNAME to locate the home directory for user software.
PM_USERNAME=${SUDO_USER:-$USER}

PM_USERHOME=`eval echo ~$PM_USERNAME`
