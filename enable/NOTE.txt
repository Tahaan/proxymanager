# Add soft-links here for modules to include them during the "switch-on" process
# as well as during the check status process.
#
# Links are named E##module or suE##modules
# Example:
# E22bashrc -> ../modules/bashrc
# suE02apt -> ../modules/apt
#
# Note: Links to modules starting with suE will be executed through sudo
#       Links to modules starting with E will be sourced inline
#       Links not starting with either E or suE will be ignored.
#
# There are no links in this directory by default - all modules are disabled 
# by default.
