Some modules utilise a template for the static portion of configuration entries 
to be added to a program's config files.

Modules may parse templates through the built-in ProxyManager function 
ParseTemplate() which  will substitute the Proxy server and port configured for
occurences of respectively PMHOSTTAG and PMPORTTAG

Values for the Proxy Host and Proxy Port are configured in the main configuration 
file /etc/proxymanager.conf

The use of a template is optional and at the discretion of the module creator.
