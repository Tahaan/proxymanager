# Add soft-links here for modules to include them during the "switch-off"
# process. Links are named D##module or suD##modules
# Example:
# D01bashrc -> ../modules/bashrc
# suD33apt -> ../modules/apt
#
# Note: Links to modules starting with suD will be executed through sudo
#       Links to modules starting with D will be sourced inline
#       Links not starting with either D or suD will be ignored.
#
# By default there will not be any links in this directory - all modules are
# effectively disabled by default.
