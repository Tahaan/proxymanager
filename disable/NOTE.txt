# Add soft-links here to activate modules to be used during the Disable Proxy 
# setting process. Links are to be named D##module or suD##modules
# Example:
# D01bashrc -> ../modules/bashrc
# suD33apt -> ../modules/apt
#
# Note: Links to modules starting with suD will be executed through sudo
#       Links to modules starting with D will be sourced inline
#       Links not starting with either D or suD will be ignored.
#
# There are no links in this directory by default - eg no modules active
